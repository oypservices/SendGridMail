### Added
- Extracted some logic into helpers
- Using a getEmptyRequest helper to avoid code duplication
- emptyRequest now accepts an object with data to extend the empty request with, this will allow simpler syntax for initializing requests.
- Callback function now receives two parameters as per Node conventions (error, response)
- If no callback provided, the method will return a promise instead.
- Implemented promise API when not passing a callback function
- Using native Promise by default if present, but allow users to override this with any other implementation by setting Sendgrid.Promise to any value, e.g. Sendgrid.Promise = require('bluebird')
